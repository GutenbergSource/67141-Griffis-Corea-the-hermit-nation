<HTML><BODY>With the winter-Olympics upcoming, and much political brouhaha in which two pooh-bahs threaten to blow up each other, the eye of the world is on Korea. Unfortunately, on both sides the tantrum is more to distract from serious issues at home than indicative of any serious conflict of interest. Remember, this is a post-1984 world and we've always been at war with Eastasia.

<p>For many centuries little was known about this historically secluded country, that for centuries went its own course, ruled by despotic leaders, in splendid isolation (North Korea in that sense follows an old tradition); until it was finally overrun by foreigners in the second half of the nineteenth century, A century and a half later, the Southern half has unexpectedly morphed into a place that exports electronics, cars, soap-operas and k-pop, and has the fastest internet in the World.

</p><p>This 1911 book tries to give some impression of Korea at that time.

</p><p>No particular difficulties expected, so have fun!
